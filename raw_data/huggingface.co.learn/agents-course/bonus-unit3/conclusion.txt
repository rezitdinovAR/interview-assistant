# Conclusion

 
If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! 🥳 You’ve successfully built your very own Pokémon battle agent! ⚔️🎮
 
You’ve conquered the fundamentals of **Agentic workflows**, connected an **LLM** to a game environment, and deployed an intelligent Agent ready to face the challenges of battle.
 
But the journey doesn’t end here!
Now that you have your first Agent up and running, think about how you can evolve it further:
 
- Can you improve its strategic thinking?
- How would a memory mechanism or feedback loop change its performance?
- What experiments could help make it more competitive in battle?
 
We’d love to hear your thoughts on the course and how we can make it even better for future learners.

**Keep learning, Keep training, keep battling, and stay awesome!** 🤗
