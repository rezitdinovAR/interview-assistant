Welcome to this **bonus unit**, where you’ll explore the exciting intersection of **AI Agents and games**! 🎮🤖
 
Imagine a game where non-playable characters (NPCs) don’t just follow scripted lines, but instead hold dynamic conversations, adapt to your strategies, and evolve as the story unfolds. This is the power of combining **LLMs and agentic behavior in games**: it opens the door to **emergent storytelling and gameplay like never before**.
 
In this bonus unit, you’ll:
 
- Learn how to build an AI Agent that can engage in **Pokémon-style turn-based battles**
- Play against it, or even challenge other agents online
 
We’ve already seen [some](https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking) [examples](https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon) from the AI community for playing Pokémon using LLMs, and in this unit you’ll learn how you can replicate that using your own Agent with the ideas that you’ve learnt through the course.
