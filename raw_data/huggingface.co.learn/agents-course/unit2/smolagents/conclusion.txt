Congratulations on finishing the `smolagents` module of this second Unit 🥳
 
You’ve just mastered the fundamentals of `smolagents` and you’ve built your own Agent! Now that you have skills in `smolagents`, you can now start to create Agents that will solve tasks you’re interested about.
 
In the next module, you’re going to learn **how to build Agents with LlamaIndex**.
