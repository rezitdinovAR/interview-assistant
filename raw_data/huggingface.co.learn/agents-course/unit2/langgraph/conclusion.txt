# Conclusion

 
Congratulations on finishing the `LangGraph` module of this second Unit! 🥳
 
You’ve now mastered the fundamentals of building structured workflows with LangGraph which you will be able to send to production.
 
This module is just the beginning of your journey with LangGraph. For more advanced topics, we recommend:
 
- Exploring the [official LangGraph documentation](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
- Taking the comprehensive [Introduction to LangGraph](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph) course from LangChain Academy
- Build something yourself !
 
In the next Unit, you’ll now explore real use cases. It’s time to leave theory to get into real action !
