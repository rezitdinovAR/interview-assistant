Welcome to this next part of our journey, where you’ll learn **how to build applications** using the [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) framework designed to help you structure and orchestrate complex LLM workflows.
 
`LangGraph` is a framework that allows you to build **production-ready** applications by giving you **control** tools over the flow of your agent.
 

## Module Overview

 
In this unit, you’ll discover:
 

### 1️⃣ What is LangGraph, and when to use it?

 

### 2️⃣ Building Blocks of LangGraph

 

### 3️⃣ Alfred, the mail sorting butler

 

### 4️⃣ Alfred, the document Analyst agent

 

### 5️⃣ Quiz

 
> The examples in this section require access to a powerful LLM/VLM model. We ran them using the GPT-4o API because it has the best compatibility with langGraph.
 
By the end of this unit, you’ll be equipped to build robust, organized and production ready applications !
 
That being said, this section is an introduction to LangGraph and more advanced topics can be discovered in the free LangChain academy course : [Introduction to LangGraph](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph)
