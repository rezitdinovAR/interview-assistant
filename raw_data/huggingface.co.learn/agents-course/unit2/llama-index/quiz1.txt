# Small Quiz (ungraded)

 
So far we’ve discussed the key components and tools used in LlamaIndex.
It’s time to make a short quiz, since **testing yourself** is the best way to learn and [to avoid the illusion of competence](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/illusions-of-competence-BuFzf).
This will help you find **where you need to reinforce your knowledge**.
 
This is an optional quiz and it’s not graded.
 

### Q1: What is a QueryEngine?

 
Which of the following best describes a QueryEngine component?
  A system that only processes static text without any retrieval capabilities.  A component that finds and retrieves relevant information as part of the RAG process.  A tool that only stores vector embeddings without search functionality.  A component that only evaluates response quality.    

### Q2: What is the Purpose of FunctionTools?

 
Why are FunctionTools important for an Agent?
  To handle large amounts of data storage.  To convert Python functions into tools that an agent can use.  To allow agents to create random functions definitions.  To only process text data.    

### Q3: What are Toolspecs in LlamaIndex?

 
What is the main purpose of Toolspecs?
  They are redundant components that don't add functionality.  They are sets of community-created tools that extend agent capabilities.  They are used solely for memory management.  They only work with text processing.    

### Q4: What is Required to create a tool?

 
What information must be included when creating a tool?
  A function, a name, and description must be defined.  Only the name is required.  Only the description is required.  Only the function is required.    
Congrats on finishing this Quiz 🥳, if you missed some elements, take time to read again the chapter to reinforce your knowledge. If you pass it, you’re ready to dive deeper into building with these components!
