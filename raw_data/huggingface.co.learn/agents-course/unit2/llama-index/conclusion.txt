Congratulations on finishing the `llama-index` module of this second Unit 🥳
 
You’ve just mastered the fundamentals of `llama-index` and you’ve seen how to build your own agentic workflows!
Now that you have skills in `llama-index`, you can start to create search engines that will solve tasks you’re interested in.
 
In the next module of the unit, you’re going to learn **how to build Agents with LangGraph**.
 
Finally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**.
