Welcome to the most exciting topic in AI today: **Agents**!
 
This free course will take you on a journey, **from beginner to expert**, in understanding, using and building AI agents.
 
This first unit will help you onboard:
 
- Discover the **course’s syllabus**.
- **Choose the path** you’re going to take (either self-audit or certification process).
- **Get more information about the certification process**.
- Get to know the team behind the course.
- Create your **Hugging Face account**.
- **Sign-up to our Discord server**, and meet your classmates and us.
 
Let’s get started!
 

## What to expect from this course?

 
In this course, you will:
 
- 📖 Study AI Agents in **theory, design, and practice.**
- 🧑‍💻 Learn to **use established AI Agent libraries** such as [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).
- 💾 **Share your agents** on the Hugging Face Hub and explore agents created by the community.
- 🏆 Participate in challenges where you will **evaluate your agents against other students’.**
- 🎓 **Earn a certificate of completion** by completing assignments.
 
And more!
 
At the end of this course, you’ll understand **how Agents work and how to build your own Agents using the latest libraries and tools**.
 
Don’t forget to **sign up to the course!**
 
(We are respectful of your privacy. We collect your email address to be able to **send you the links when each Unit is published and give you information about the challenges and updates**).
 

## What does the course look like?

 
The course is composed of:
 
- *Foundational Units*: where you learn Agents **concepts in theory**.
- *Hands-on*: where you’ll learn **to use established AI Agent libraries** to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on sections will be **Hugging Face Spaces** with a pre-configured environment.
- *Use case assignments*: where you’ll apply the concepts you’ve learned to solve a real-world problem that you’ll choose.
- *The Challenge*: you’ll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Students_leaderboard) for you to compare the agents’ performance.
 
This **course is a living project, evolving with your feedback and contributions!** Feel free to [open issues and PRs in GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/agents-course), and engage in discussions in our Discord server.
 
After you have gone through the course, you can also send your feedback  [👉 using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9VaONn0eglax0uTwi29rIn4tM7H2sYmmybmG5jJNlE5v0xA/viewform?usp=dialog)
 

## What’s the syllabus?

 
Here is the **general syllabus for the course**. A more detailed list of topics will be released with each unit.
 Chapter Topic Description 0 Onboarding Set you up with the tools and platforms that you will use. 1 Agent Fundamentals Explain Tools, Thoughts, Actions, Observations, and their formats. Explain LLMs, messages, special tokens and chat templates. Show a simple use case using python functions as tools. 2 Frameworks Understand how the fundamentals are implemented in popular libraries : smolagents, LangGraph, LLamaIndex 3 Use Cases Let’s build some real life use cases (open to PRs 🤗 from experienced Agent builders) 4 Final Assignment Build an agent for a selected benchmark and prove your understanding of Agents on the student leaderboard  🚀 
In addition to the main syllabus, you have 3 bonus units:
 
- *Bonus Unit 1* : Fine-tuning an LLM for Function-calling
- *Bonus Unit 2* : Agent Observability and Evaluation
- *Bonus Unit 3* : Agents in Games with Pokemon
 
For instance, in the Bonus Unit 3, you learn to build your Agent to play Pokemon battles 🥊.
 

## What are the prerequisites?

 
To be able to follow this course, you should have a:
 
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic knowledge of LLMs (we have a section in Unit 1 to recap what they are)
 

## What tools do I need?

 
You only need 2 things:
 
- *A computer* with an internet connection.
- A *Hugging Face Account*: to push and load models, agents, and create Spaces. If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one **here** (it’s free).

## The Certification Process

 
![Two paths](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit0/three-paths.jpg)
 
You can choose to follow this course *in audit mode*, or do the activities and *get one of the two certificates we’ll issue*.
 
If you audit the course, you can participate in all the challenges and do assignments if you want, and **you don’t need to notify us**.
 
The certification process is **completely free**:
 
- *To get a certification for fundamentals*: you need to complete Unit 1 of the course. This is intended for students that want to get up to date with the latest trends in Agents.
- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete Unit 1, one of the use case assignments we’ll propose during the course, and the final challenge.
 
There’s **no deadline** for the certification process.
 

## What is the recommended pace?
