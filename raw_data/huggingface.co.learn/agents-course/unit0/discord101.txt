### How to use Discord effectively

 
Here are a few tips for using Discord effectively:
 
- **Voice channels** are available, though text chat is more commonly used.
- You can format text using **markdown style**, which is especially useful for writing code. Note that markdown doesn’t work as well for links.
- Consider opening threads for **long conversations** to keep discussions organized.
