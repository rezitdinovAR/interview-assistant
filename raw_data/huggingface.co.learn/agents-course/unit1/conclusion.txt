# Conclusion

 
Congratulations on finishing this first Unit 🥳
 
You’ve just **mastered the fundamentals of Agents** and you’ve created your first AI Agent!
 
It’s **normal if you still feel confused by some of these elements**. Agents are a complex topic and it’s common to take a while to grasp everything.
 
**Take time to really grasp the material** before continuing. It’s important to master these elements and have a solid foundation before entering the fun part.
 
And if you pass the Quiz test, don’t forget to get your certificate 🎓 👉 [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/unit1-certification-app)

In the next (bonus) unit, you’re going to learn **to fine-tune a Agent to do function calling (aka to be able to call tools based on user prompt)**.
 
Finally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**. If you have some feedback then, please 👉 [fill this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9VaONn0eglax0uTwi29rIn4tM7H2sYmmybmG5jJNlE5v0xA/viewform?usp=dialog)
