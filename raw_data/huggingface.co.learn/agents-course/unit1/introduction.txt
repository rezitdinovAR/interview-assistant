Welcome to this first unit, where **you’ll build a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI Agents** including:
 
- **Understanding Agents**
 
- What is an Agent, and how does it work?
- How do Agents make decisions using reasoning and planning?
- **The Role of LLMs (Large Language Models) in Agents**
 
- How LLMs serve as the “brain” behind an Agent.
- How LLMs structure conversations via the Messages system.
- **Tools and Actions**
 
- How Agents use external tools to interact with the environment.
- How to build and integrate tools for your Agent.
- **The Agent Workflow:**
 
- *Think* → *Act* → *Observe*.
 
After exploring these topics, **you’ll build your first Agent** using `smolagents`!
 
Your Agent, named Alfred, will handle a simple task and demonstrate how to apply these concepts in practice.
 
You’ll even learn how to **publish your Agent on Hugging Face Spaces**, so you can share it with friends and colleagues.
 
Finally, at the end of this Unit, you’ll take a quiz. Pass it, and you’ll **earn your first course certification**: the 🎓 Certificate of Fundamentals of Agents.
