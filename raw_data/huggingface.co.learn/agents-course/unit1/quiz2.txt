# Quick Self-Check (ungraded)

 
What?! Another Quiz? We know, we know, … 😅 But this short, ungraded quiz is here to **help you reinforce key concepts you’ve just learned**.
 
This quiz covers Large Language Models (LLMs), message systems, and tools; essential components for understanding and building AI agents.
 

### Q1: Which of the following best describes an AI tool?

  A process that only generates text responses  An executable process or external API that allows agents to perform specific tasks and interact with external environments  A feature that stores agent conversations    

### Q2: How do AI agents use tools as a form of “acting” in an environment?

  By passively waiting for user instructions  By only using pre-programmed responses  By asking the LLM to generate tool invocation code when appropriate and running tools on behalf of the model    

### Q3: What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

  A simple chatbot designed to respond with pre-defined answers  A deep learning model trained on large amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language  A rule-based AI that follows strict predefined commands    

### Q4: Which of the following best describes the role of special tokens in LLMs?

  They are additional words stored in the model's vocabulary to enhance text generation quality  They serve specific functions like marking the end of a sequence (EOS) or separating different message roles in chat models  They are randomly inserted tokens used to improve response variability    

### Q5: How do AI chat models process user messages internally?

  They directly interpret messages as structured commands with no transformations  They convert user messages into a formatted prompt by concatenating system, user, and assistant messages  They generate responses randomly based on previous conversations    
Got it? Great! Now let’s **dive into the complete Agent flow and start building your first AI Agent!**
