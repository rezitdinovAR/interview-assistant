Welcome to the final unit of the course! 🎉
 
So far, you’ve **built a strong foundation in AI Agents**, from understanding their components to creating your own. With this knowledge, you’re now ready to **build powerful agents** and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in this fast-evolving field.
 
This unit is all about applying what you’ve learned. It’s your **final hands-on project**, and completing it is your ticket to earning the **course certificate**.
 

## What’s the challenge?

 
You’ll create your own agent and **evaluate its performance using a subset of the GAIA benchmark**.
 
To successfully complete the course, your agent needs to score **30% or higher** on the benchmark. Achieve that, and you’ll earn your **Certificate of Completion**, officially recognizing your expertise. 🏅
 
Additionally, see how you stack up against your peers! A dedicated **Student Leaderboard** is available for you to submit your scores and see the community’s progress.
 
> 🚨 Heads Up: Advanced & Hands-On UnitPlease be aware that this unit shifts towards a more practical, hands-on approach. Success in this section will requiremore advanced coding knowledgeand relies on you navigating tasks withless explicit guidancecompared to earlier parts of the course.
 
Sounds exciting? Let’s get started! 🚀
