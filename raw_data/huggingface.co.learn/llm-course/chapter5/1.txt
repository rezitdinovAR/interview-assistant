# Introduction

   
In [Chapter 3](/course/chapter3) you got your first taste of the 🤗 Datasets library and saw that there were three main steps when it came to fine-tuning a model:
 
1. Load a dataset from the Hugging Face Hub.
2. Preprocess the data with `Dataset.map()`.
3. Load and compute metrics.
 
But this is just scratching the surface of what 🤗 Datasets can do! In this chapter, we will take a deep dive into the library. Along the way, we’ll find answers to the following questions:
 
- What do you do when your dataset is not on the Hub?
- How can you slice and dice a dataset? (And what if you *really* need to use Pandas?)
- What do you do when your dataset is huge and will melt your laptop’s RAM?
- What the heck are “memory mapping” and Apache Arrow?
- How can you create your own dataset and push it to the Hub?
 
The techniques you learn here will prepare you for the advanced tokenization and fine-tuning tasks in [Chapter 6](/course/chapter6) and [Chapter 7](/course/chapter7) — so grab a coffee and let’s get started!
