# Introduction to Gradio

   
In this chapter we will be learning about how to build **interactive demos** for your machine learning models.
 
Why build a demo or a GUI for your machine learning model in the first place? Demos allow:
 
- **Machine learning developers** to easily present their work to a wide audience including non-technical teams or customers
- **Researchers** to more easily reproduce machine learning models and behavior
- **Quality testers** or **end users** to more easily identify and debug failure points of models
- **Diverse users** to discover algorithmic biases in models
 
We’ll be using the Gradio library to build demos for our models. Gradio allows you to build, customize, and share web-based demos for any machine learning model, entirely in Python.
 
Here are some examples of machine learning demos built with Gradio:
 
- A **sketch recognition** model that takes in a sketch and outputs labels of what it thinks is being drawn:
  
- An extractive **question answering** model that takes in a context paragraph and a quest and outputs a response and a probability score (we discussed this kind of model [in Chapter 7](/course/chapter7/7)):
  
- A **background removal** model that takes in an image and outputs the image with the background removed:
  
This chapter is broken down into sections which include both *concepts* and *applications*. After you learn the concept in each section, you’ll apply it to build a particular kind of demo, ranging from image classification to speech recognition. By the time you finish this chapter, you’ll be able to build these demos (and many more!) in just a few lines of Python code.
