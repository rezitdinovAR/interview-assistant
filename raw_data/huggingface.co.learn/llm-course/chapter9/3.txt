# Understanding the Interface class

    
In this section, we will take a closer look at the `Interface` class, and understand the
main parameters used to create one.
 

## How to create an Interface

 
You’ll notice that the `Interface` class has 3 required parameters:
 
`Interface(fn, inputs, outputs, ...)`
 
These parameters are:
 
- `fn`: the prediction function that is wrapped by the Gradio interface. This function can take one or more parameters and return one or more values
- `inputs`: the input component type(s). Gradio provides many pre-built components such as`"image"` or `"mic"`.
- `outputs`: the output component type(s). Again, Gradio provides many pre-built components e.g. `"image"` or `"label"`.
 
For a complete list of components, [see the Gradio docs](https://gradio.app/docs). Each pre-built component can be customized by instantiating the class corresponding to the component.
 
For example, as we saw in the [previous section](/course/chapter9/2),
instead of passing in `"textbox"` to the `inputs` parameter, you can pass in a `Textbox(lines=7, label="Prompt")` component to create a textbox with 7 lines and a label.
 
Let’s take a look at another example, this time with an `Audio` component.
 

## A simple example with audio

 
As mentioned earlier, Gradio provides many different inputs and outputs.
So let’s build an `Interface` that works with audio.
 
In this example, we’ll build an audio-to-audio function that takes an
audio file and simply reverses it.
 
We will use for the input the `Audio` component. When using the `Audio` component,
you can specify whether you want the `source` of the audio to be a file that the user
uploads or a microphone that the user records their voice with. In this case, let’s
set it to a `"microphone"`. Just for fun, we’ll add a label to our `Audio` that says
“Speak here…“.
 
In addition, we’d like to receive the audio as a numpy array so that we can easily
“reverse” it. So we’ll set the `"type"` to be `"numpy"`, which passes the input
data as a tuple of (`sample_rate`, `data`) into our function.
 
We will also use the `Audio` output component which can automatically
render a tuple with a sample rate and numpy array of data as a playable audio file.
In this case, we do not need to do any customization, so we will use the string
shortcut `"audio"`.
  
```
import numpy as np
import gradio as gr

def reverse_audio(audio):
    sr, data = audio
    reversed_audio = (sr, np.flipud(data))
    return reversed_audio

mic = gr.Audio(source="microphone", type="numpy", label="Speak here...")
gr.Interface(reverse_audio, mic, "audio").launch()
```
 
The code above will produce an interface like the one below (if your browser doesn’t
ask you for microphone permissions, [open the demo in  a separate tab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/course-demos/audio-reverse).)
  
You should now be able to record your voice and hear yourself speaking in reverse - spooky 👻!
 

## Handling multiple inputs and outputs

 
Let’s say we had a more complicated function, with multiple inputs and outputs.
In the example below, we have a function that takes a dropdown index, a slider value, and number,
and returns an audio sample of a musical tone.
 
Take a look how we pass a list of input and output components,
and see if you can follow along what’s happening.
 
The key here is that when you pass:
 
- a list of input components, each component corresponds to a parameter in order.
- a list of output coponents, each component corresponds to a returned value.
 
The code snippet below shows how three input components line up with the three arguments of the `generate_tone()` function:
  
```
import numpy as np
import gradio as gr

notes = ["C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#", "A", "A#", "B"]

def generate_tone(note, octave, duration):
    sr = 48000
    a4_freq, tones_from_a4 = 440, 12 * (octave - 4) + (note - 9)
    frequency = a4_freq * 2 ** (tones_from_a4 / 12)
    duration = int(duration)
    audio = np.linspace(0, duration, duration * sr)
    audio = (20000 * np.sin(audio * (2 * np.pi * frequency))).astype(np.int16)
    return (sr, audio)

gr.Interface(
    generate_tone,
    [
        gr.Dropdown(notes, type="index"),
        gr.Slider(minimum=4, maximum=6, step=1),
        gr.Number(value=1, label="Duration in seconds"),
    ],
    "audio",
).launch()
```
  

### The launch() method

 
So far, we have used the `launch()` method to launch the interface, but we
haven’t really discussed what it does.
 
By default, the `launch()` method will launch the demo in a web server that
is running locally. If you are running your code in a Jupyter or Colab notebook, then
Gradio will embed the demo GUI in the notebook so you can easily use it.
 
You can customize the behavior of `launch()` through different parameters:
 
- `inline` - whether to display the interface inline on Python notebooks.
- `inbrowser` - whether to automatically launch the interface in a new tab on the default browser.
- `share` - whether to create a publicly shareable link from your computer for the interface. Kind of like a Google Drive link!
 
We’ll cover the `share` parameter in a lot more detail in the next section!
 

## ✏️ Let’s apply it!

 
Let’s build an interface that allows you to demo a **speech-recognition** model.
To make it interesting, we will accept *either* a mic input or an uploaded file.
 
As usual, we’ll load our speech recognition model using the `pipeline()` function from 🤗 Transformers.
If you need a quick refresher, you can go back to [that section in Chapter 1](/course/chapter1/3).   Next, we’ll implement a `transcribe_audio()` function that processes the audio and returns the transcription. Finally, we’ll wrap this function in an `Interface` with the `Audio` components for the inputs and just text for the output. Altogether, the code for this application is the following:
  
```
from transformers import pipeline
import gradio as gr

model = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition")

def transcribe_audio(audio):
    transcription = model(audio)["text"]
    return transcription

gr.Interface(
    fn=transcribe_audio,
    inputs=gr.Audio(type="filepath"),
    outputs="text",
).launch()
```
 
If your browser doesn’t ask you for microphone permissions, [open the demo in a separate tab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/course-demos/audio-reverse).
  
That’s it! You can now use this interface to transcribe audio. Notice here that
by passing in the `optional` parameter as `True`, we allow the user to either
provide a microphone or an audio file (or neither, but that will return an error message).
 
Keep going to see how to share your interface with others!
