# End-of-chapter quiz

   
Let’s test what you learned in this chapter!
 

### 1. What are models on the Hub limited to?

  Models from the 🤗 Transformers library.  All models with a similar interface to 🤗 Transformers.  There are no limits.  Models that are in some way related to NLP.   

### 2. How can you manage models on the Hub?

  Through a GCP account.  Through peer-to-peer distribution.  Through git and git-lfs.   

### 3. What can you do using the Hugging Face Hub web interface?

  Fork an existing repository.  Create a new model repository.  Manage and edit files.  Upload files.  See diffs across versions.   

### 4. What is a model card?

  A rough description of the model, therefore less important than the model and tokenizer files.  A way to ensure reproducibility, reusability, and fairness.  A Python file that can be run to retrieve information about the model.   

### 5. Which of these objects of the 🤗 Transformers library can be directly shared on the Hub with push_to_hub() ?

  A tokenizer  A model configuration  A model  A Trainer   

### 6. What is the first step when using the push_to_hub() method or the CLI tools?

  Log in on the website.  Run 'huggingface-cli login' in a terminal.  Run 'notebook_login()' in a notebook.   

### 7. You’re using a model and a tokenizer — how can you upload them to the Hub?

  By calling the push_to_hub method directly on the model and the tokenizer.  Within the Python runtime, by wrapping them in a `huggingface_hub` utility.  By saving them to disk and calling `transformers-cli upload-model`   

### 8. Which git operations can you do with the Repository class?

  A commit.  A pull  A push  A merge
