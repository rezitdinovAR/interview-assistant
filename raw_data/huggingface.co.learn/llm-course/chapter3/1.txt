# Introduction

   
In [Chapter 2](/course/chapter2) we explored how to use tokenizers and pretrained models to make predictions. But what if you want to fine-tune a pretrained model to solve a specific task? That’s the topic of this chapter! You will learn:
 
- How to prepare a large dataset from the Hub using the latest 🤗 Datasets features
- How to use the high-level `Trainer` API to fine-tune a model with modern best practices
- How to implement a custom training loop with optimization techniques
- How to leverage the 🤗 Accelerate library to easily run distributed training on any setup
- How to apply current fine-tuning best practices for maximum performance
 
> 📚Essential Resources: Before starting, you might want to review the🤗 Datasets documentationfor data processing.
 
This chapter will also serve as an introduction to some Hugging Face libraries beyond the 🤗 Transformers library! We’ll see how libraries like 🤗 Datasets, 🤗 Tokenizers, 🤗 Accelerate, and 🤗 Evaluate can help you train models more efficiently and effectively.
 
Each of the main sections in this chapter will teach you something different:
 
- **Section 2**: Learn modern data preprocessing techniques and efficient dataset handling
- **Section 3**: Master the powerful Trainer API with all its latest features
- **Section 4**: Implement training loops from scratch and understand distributed training with Accelerate
 
By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to fine-tune models on your own datasets using both high-level APIs and custom training loops, applying the latest best practices in the field.
 
> 🎯What You’ll Build: By the end of this chapter, you’ll have fine-tuned a BERT model for text classification and understand how to adapt the techniques to your own datasets and tasks.
 
This chapter focuses exclusively on **PyTorch**, as it has become the standard framework for modern deep learning research and production. We’ll use the latest APIs and best practices from the Hugging Face ecosystem.
